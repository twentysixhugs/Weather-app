# Weather app

**The live preview is available in GitHub pages**

*I know the API key is publicly exposed here.
When I build this project, I didn't yet know how to use backend at all
The key is free, so I had nothing to lose and just wanted to practice what I
learned about fetching and asynchronous JavaScript*

## Key features

- Fetches data from an API
- It looks nice. Really
