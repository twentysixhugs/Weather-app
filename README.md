## Key features

- Fetches weather data from an API

---
*I know the API key is publicly exposed here.
When I was building this project, I didn't yet know how to use the backend and secure API there at all
The key is free, so I had nothing to lose and just wanted to practice what I
learned about fetching and asynchronous JavaScript*
